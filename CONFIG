# This is the config to know:
# 1- which files should simply be ignored
# 2- which files (more precisely, directories) should have their children
#    symlinked instead of themselves (e.g. for a directory like .config/foo, you
#    don't want to symlink .config directly in ~/ because it is probably used by
#    other applications. Instead, you want to symlink .config/foo inside
#    ~/.config)
# 3- all the other files will be symlinked directly in the home

# Ignore these
cfg_ignore=("CONFIG" "README.md" "bin" "todo"	# This repo
	".git" ".gitignore" ".gitmodules"	# Git
	"*.orig" "*.rej"			# Patch residues
	".*.swp" "*~" "\#*\#"			# Vim/Emacs
	".DS_Store"				# Mac
	"tags" "TAGS")				# CTags

# As explained above, link what's inside
cfg_first_child=(".config")

# Destination: home directory
cfg_dest_dir=/tmp/a

# Relative path: if not set, use absolute path, otherwise, trust the user that
# the dotfiles directory is located at the given value relative to
# cfg_dest_dir.
# E.g: If cfg_dest_dir is /home/foo and the dotfiles directory is in
# /home/foo/git/dotfiles, then you should put "git/dotfiles" in there.
cfg_dotfiles_relative_path="git/dotfiles"
